//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//This repository contains sample programs for my coding portfolio. This portfolio is intended to demonstrate my knowledge of the C# programming language and depict my progression during the 16-week course.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//The Microsoft Systems and Software Academy (MSSA) is a course which offers transitioning servicemembers and veterans an opportunity

//....................

//The final project in this class is to produce a portfolio of at least 50 sample c# programs that demonstrate topics discussed in the class. This repository will contain a collection of possible (suggested) sample programs provided by the instructor for task #1 (below).

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//PROJECT TASKS:
//find suitable example programs hopefully written by professional programmers,

//carefully read the program code to figure out (as much as possible) what the program does and how it does it

//document your findings by annotating the code with program comments that demonstrate your understanding of the program

//compile and get the program running... debug it if necessary

//augment the program to better demonstrate its functionality

//capture the program output and append it to the end of your source code

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//REQUIRED SEGMENTS:

//the original source code of the sample program

//document the source and (if possible) the author of the sample program

//summarize the program functionality in a one-liner comment

//summarize your changes and improvements to the program

//the final source code of the sample program

//a terminal comment containing the sample program output

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//WAYS TO MAXIMIZE LEARNING:

//expand the functionality of the sample program

//put the sample program aside, and rewrite it from scratch... as much as possible on your own

//choose and implement challenge programs from third-party textbooks and websites
